# GTM Engineer Tools

Claude Code plugins for people who run go-to-market on a stack they built themselves.

These were extracted from a working setup rather than written as examples. The mechanics in them are the cheap part; the rules that came out of things going wrong are the reason they're worth installing.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add le0li0n/gtm-engineer-tools
```

Then install what you want:

```
/plugin install reply-queue
/plugin install automerge
/plugin install deck-graphics
/plugin install deck-builder
/plugin install infographics
/plugin install always-worktree
/plugin install canonical
/plugin install permissions
/plugin install forbidden
/plugin install slop-check
```

## What's here

### `reply-queue`

One pass over every outbound campaign you have in flight, ending in a queue of cards — one per person waiting on you, each with the reply already drafted.

**Drafts everywhere it can. Sends nowhere.** Mail replies are written into your drafts folder, on the thread, with the right recipient and subject, waiting for one click. Channels with no draft object come back paste-ready. The scheduled version's tool allow-list is asymmetric on purpose: draft creation is in, send is out on every channel. "Never sends" is a fact about what it can do, not a rule it's been asked to follow.

Run `/reply-queue-setup` in your repo. It interviews you, writes the registry, resolves your campaign ids against whatever sources are connected, and prints the routine prompt for you to schedule yourself.

### `automerge`

For repos where PRs pile up because there's nobody to review them — which is most solo and small-team repos where an agent opens the PRs.

Installs a scheduled workflow that squash-merges any open PR at least 15 minutes old with no conflict, no failing check, no `hold` label, and not a draft. Deliberately not GitHub's own auto-merge, which needs branch protection that private repos on the free plan don't get.

One script, three idempotent steps, and one PR you merge by hand at the end — GitHub only runs scheduled workflows from the default branch, so it can't merge itself in.

### `deck-graphics`

A talk needs thirty small graphics: a dozen vendor logos, a handful of icons in the house style, three screenshots that show an app without showing a customer. This fills them from a manifest. Logos come through a chain that degrades instead of failing (Brandfetch, then SimpleIcons, then Google's favicon service, or a URL or file you pin when the chain gets a mark wrong). Props come through an image model with your existing illustrations passed as references, so the new ones match. Mocks are HTML you control, rendered through headless Chrome. Every file gets a sidecar saying which tier or which model, prompt and seed produced it.

The scripts are the cheap part. `/deck-graphics:fill` then looks at every PNG and judges it: does it read at slide size, does it match the references, is there text baked in, is the logo on a transparent ground, is it the right mark. That look is what makes the result trustworthy.

Assets and sidecars only. It pairs with `deck-builder`, or with any deck builder you already have, since what it writes is a PNG and a sidecar per graphic. Needs an OpenRouter key for props, a free Brandfetch client ID for real logos, and Chrome.

### `deck-builder`

A talk usually needs two decks. One is for the stage, where a slide full of text splits the room between listening and reading. The other is sent afterwards and has to make sense with nobody presenting it. Kept by hand, they drift within a week. This builds both as HTML slides in your own brand, checks that they still match slide for slide, and writes the stage version's speaker notes from the other one's text.

Then someone asks for the slides in Google Slides so they can edit them. Before exporting, it renders each slide twice, once as designed and once from only what an editable PowerPoint can hold, and compares the two. Where they differ it names the slides and the reason (a glow on a headline, letter spacing Google Slides drops, a font it doesn't have), and you choose per slide: editable, editable with the effect baked into a picture behind the text, or a picture of the slide. The PDF keeps everything.

Every default, two versions and five words on a stage slide included, is printed at the start of a build and can be changed or switched off. It ships no brand: one `brand.json` points at your design system, and deck-graphics reads the same file. Needs Python 3.9+, Chrome, and `pillow` and `python-pptx` for the check and the PowerPoint.

### `infographics`

The graphics that do well on LinkedIn look like reference sheets someone spent hours on: a bold headline that states the finding, one keyword in color, real logos and faces, numbers with a source, a body dense enough to save. This renders them from a JSON spec. Nineteen template types (layers, stack, workflow, decision tree, who-to-follow, events, mistakes vs fixes, campaign breakdown, comparison, stats, trend and more), each with a placeholder spec and a rendered preview to copy.

Five color kits rotate automatically, so a feed posting three times a week doesn't repeat a look; your own kits join the rotation. Before anyone looks, the render is checked for overflow, text spilling out of its box, overlaps, phone legibility, spelling and numbers with no source. Then the skill looks at every PNG, because the checks once passed graphics with arrows hidden under cards.

The renderer never writes copy. `/infographics:setup` writes one config with your name, URL, headshot and wordmarks. Needs Chrome and Node 22; no npm packages.

### `always-worktree`

Keeps an agent off your default branch. A session opens in the main checkout on `main`, the first edit lands there, and by the time anyone notices there are six commits on `main` that should have been a PR. Or two sessions open in the same checkout and edit the same files.

On the default branch, Write and Edit are refused with a message naming the fix: move to a worktree. Bash commands that look like writes (a redirect, a heredoc, `sed -i`, `git commit`) are refused too, and reads pass. Each prompt also gets a line telling the agent where it is, so it usually moves before it tries to edit.

When you do mean to work on `main`, `/always-worktree:main-ok` allows it for four hours and then expires. It runs when you ask for it, never because the guard fired. Needs Python 3.

### `canonical`

An agent asked for current positioning reads a six-year-old deck in Drive, because nothing told it where to look first or when to stop. `CANONICAL.md` is a short table that says, for each kind of company information, where it lives in the order to look, who owns it, and when someone last confirmed it.

`/canonical:where positioning` answers from the table. `--stale` lists the rows whose owner hasn't re-confirmed them on schedule, and `--check` validates the file. `/canonical:setup` writes the template and fills it in with you one row at a time, then adds the line to `CLAUDE.md` that makes every session read it. No hook ships. Needs Python 3.

[Full documentation →](./canonical/)

### `permissions`

Paths only named people may change. Positioning is one person's call, and a signed contract isn't edited by whoever happens to be passing. The rules sit in `PERMISSIONS.md`, and every governed row of a `CANONICAL.md` counts as one too. A miss either refuses the edit or lets it through as a proposal once the rule has been stated, to reach the owner as a PR labelled `hold`.

Enforced three ways: a hook on Claude's writes, a pre-commit check if you wire it in, and a `CODEOWNERS` file that `/permissions:codeowners` generates from the same rules. Identity is whatever git config says, so it catches the honest mistake and stops nobody determined. Needs Python 3.

### `forbidden`

Secret scanners know keys. They don't know that a customer list belongs in the CRM, or that a raw export is fine in one folder and a leak in another. `FORBIDDEN.md` lists what never enters the repo and, for each kind, where it goes instead.

Objective patterns refuse the write and name the right place in the message: a card number that passes Luhn, a key with a known prefix, a PEM header with key material after it. Heuristics, such as twenty-five email addresses in one file, turn the write into a question you answer. Each detector checks more than a regex, so `sk-ant-xxxx` in a setup guide goes through. Nothing is checked in a repo until `/forbidden:init` has written the registry. Needs Python 3.

### `slop-check`

Flags AI writing tells in outward-facing prose before it's sent or published. Warns, never blocks, because a gate that fires on a judgement call gets bypassed, and rewriting prose until a regex goes quiet produces text that passes and still reads like a chatbot.

Lives in [its own repo](https://github.com/le0li0n/slop-check) with its 382-document human corpus and its attribution chain. Listed here so one marketplace covers the set.

## Why these nine

They're the parts of one person's stack that turned out to be portable. The context layer underneath them — a git repo per company holding positioning, clients, deals and call transcripts, which every agent reads before acting — is the part that matters most and the part nobody can hand you.

These are what sits on top of it.
