# reply-queue-setup

Gets the reply queue running in the current repo. One interview, one file written, one prompt to paste.

**Ask one question at a time.** This is an interview, not a form — batching them gets vague answers to the ones in the middle.

## Step 1 — Check the ground

Confirm the repo is a git checkout, then check whether `campaigns/registry.md` already exists. If it does, **do not overwrite it.** Say it's there, offer to add a campaign to it instead, and stop.

Then list the MCP connectors actually reachable in this session. That list decides what's worth asking about — there's no point interviewing someone about their sequencer if it isn't connected. Report what you found in one line before asking anything.

## Step 2 — The interview

Six questions, one at a time. Skip any the connector check already answered.

1. **Where should the queue post?** A Slack DM to yourself is the default; a channel works if others act on replies too. Email if there's no chat connector. Get the actual id or address — don't proceed on "my Slack."
2. **Which mailbox do your replies land in?** This is the one that decides whether drafts go into a drafts folder or come back as paste-text. If the connected mailbox isn't the one their campaigns send from, don't conclude anything yet: search it for a reply to one of those campaigns. Forwarding and aliases are common enough that the answer is usually yes, and one confirmed thread turns every campaign's replies into real drafts. Say which way it went, either way, rather than letting them discover it on the first run.
3. **What's in flight right now?** Get names, not ids — the ids come from the sources in step 3.
4. **For each campaign: what did it ask for?** One line each.
5. **What does a yes get?** Per campaign. This is the part people skip and it's the part that makes the drafts usable. If they can't answer, the campaign goes in as `draft` status rather than `live`.
6. **Is there a voice or author profile to write in?** Optional. A path if yes.

## Step 3 — Resolve the ids

For each named campaign, query the connected sources and match by name. Show what you matched and ask them to confirm before writing — campaign names are rarely unique and a wrong id means a playbook applied to the wrong people.

Anything you can't match goes in as `manual:` with a note, not as a guess.

## Step 4 — Write the registry

Copy `templates/registry.template.md` to `campaigns/registry.md`, fill the frontmatter from the interview, write one index row and one playbook section per campaign.

Leave the template's commentary in for any campaign whose playbook is incomplete — a visible `TODO` is better than a plausible-looking playbook that makes the checker guess. Say which ones are incomplete when you report.

## Step 5 — Hand over the routine

Print, in a fenced block ready to copy:

1. The three-sentence prompt from `templates/routine.template.md`.
2. The allow-list, with the connector names substituted for the ones actually found in step 1.
3. The cron line.

Then say plainly: **they paste this into `/schedule` themselves.** Don't create the routine for them. A scheduled agent that starts running against someone's real inbox should be a thing they deliberately turned on.

## Step 6 — Report

Four lines:

- Registry written, and how many campaigns are `live` versus `draft`.
- Which connectors resolved, and which didn't.
- Whether drafts will land in a real drafts folder or fall back to paste-text — and if it's the latter, which mailbox they'd need to connect to fix it.
- The one command to try it now: `/reply-queue`.

Suggest running it once in-session before scheduling anything. The first run against real campaigns is where a wrong id or a thin playbook shows up, and it's much better to see that in a conversation than in a Slack DM at 7am.
